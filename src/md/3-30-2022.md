POMERANIANS are descended from huge sled dog breeds and have a long and intriguing history. The foxy-faced dog is tiny, lively, and capable of competing in agility and obedience or just being a family friend. Pomeranian has a little body (under seven pounds) yet a commanding big-dog temperament. The plentiful double coat, with its frill reaching over the chest and shoulders, is available in about two dozen colors and patterns, but is most usually seen in orange or red. They are alert and bright, easy to train, and make excellent watchdogs and cheerful companions for families with youngsters old enough to distinguish between a toy dog and a toy. They are active yet can be exercised indoors or with short walks, so they can live happily in both the city and the suburbs. They'll master tricks and games with easily, but their favorite hobby is making their special person laugh and companion them.
