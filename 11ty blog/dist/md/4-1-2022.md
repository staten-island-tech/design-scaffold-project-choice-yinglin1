Since the Bible was a work in progress, MALTESE, 'Ye Ancient Dogge of Malta,' has been living in luxury. Maltese are energetic, charming, and versatile toy companions known for their show-stopping, floor-length coat. Maltese are small toy dogs with a long, straight, silky coat that weigh less than seven pounds. A tiny body moves with a fluid and elegant step beneath the all-white mantle. The overall effect is one of fluid beauty and balance. With its wide, dark eyes and black gumdrop nose, the attractive Maltese face may win over even the most jaded sensibility. Maltese, despite their aristocratic appearance, are tough and adaptable dogs. They make vigilant watchdogs who are fearless in a cute toy-dog sense, and they are competitive tiny agility athletes. Maltese are low-shedding, long-lived dogs who like meeting new people of all ages. They respond well to reward-based instruction, despite being difficult and defiant at times.
