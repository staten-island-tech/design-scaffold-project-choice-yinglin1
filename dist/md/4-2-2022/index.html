        <p>PAPILLON is a toy dog with exceptional beauty and athleticism. Despite his sophisticated appearance, the Pap is a true 'doggy dog' with a tough exterior. Papillon breeders describe their dogs as cheerful, alert, and friendly. Although a Papillon is a small dog, averaging 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder, the big, wing-shaped ears that give the breed its name ('papillon' is French for 'butterfly') allow you to distinguish one from a block away. The ears of certain Paps are erect, whereas the ears of others, known as the Phalene type, droop down. Paps have a plumed tail and a long, silky coat in a variety of color combinations, with white as the basic color. Paps are small dogs for all seasons and purposes, and they are more sturdy than they appear. They thrive in warm or cool temperatures, in cities or rural areas, and are eager to participate in family activities. They are fantastic agility dogs who consistently win at the highest levels of the sport; less ambitious owners can train them to do a variety of tricks.</p>
