        <p>The SIBERIAN HUSKY, a thickly coated, compact sled dog with exceptional stamina, was created to work in packs, pulling modest loads at moderate speeds across huge ice areas. Siberian people are kind, meticulous, and respectful. The almond-shaped eyes of the sleek, medium-sized Siberian Husky can be brown or blue'and sometimes both'and communicate a perceptive but pleasant and even mischievous look. Siberians are recognized for their powerful but seemingly easy pace, which makes them quick and nimble-footed. They are notably smaller and lighter than their robust relative, the Alaskan Malamute, weighing no more than 60 pounds. They appreciate family life and get along with other dogs because they were born as pack dogs. Because of their inherent friendliness, Sibes make poor watchdogs. These are high-energy canines who can't stop chasing tiny animals, therefore ample running space is essential. Sibes are naturally clean, with little doggy odor, which is an appealing trait of the breed. The coat of the Siberian Husky dog breed is thick and attractive, and it comes in a variety of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes, as well as their stunning facial masks, contribute to the beauty of this Siberian strain. Many people are captivated to the Siberian's wolf-like appearance, but be aware that this athletic, clever dog can act autonomously and pose a challenge to first-time dog owners. Huskies put the &quot;H&quot; in Houdini and require a yard with a high fence that extends all the way to the ground to prevent escape.</p>
